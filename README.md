## Features

- **Visual search**: Integrated with SERP API to perform image searches. The search results include visually similar items, their prices (if available), and the sources where they can be found.

- **Responsive design**: The web page adapts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless user experience on desktop and mobile devices.

- **Interactive components**: The page includes interactive elements such as an image upload button, and a search button. Upon uploading an image, it is displayed on the web page before initiating the search.

- **Dynamic content**: The search results are dynamically generated and displayed in a grid layout. Each result is presented in a card that contains the product image, title, description, price (if available), and a link to the source page.

- **CSS styling**: The stylesheets provide a sleek and modern look, in line with the aesthetics of a modern online shopping platform.
